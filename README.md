# Improvements:  

1.Used IPFS for storing the Real Estate Properties rather then local storage.  
2.Used OpenZepplin library to create a Real Estate Property NFT by reading the IPFS data.  
3.UI Changes  
4.Implemented the Escrow mechanism to facilitate the sale of the Real Estate Property.  
 '''(An Escrow mechanism is a financial arrangement in which a third party holds and regulates payment of the funds required for two parties involved in a given transaction. In this project, an Escrow mechanism was implemented to facilitate the sale of Real Estate Properties. This means that the payment for the property is held by a third party until the transaction is completed, which provides security for both the buyer and seller)'''
